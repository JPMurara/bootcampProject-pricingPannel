# Pricing Panel Project 

This is my first project which I used some of the HTML and CSS skills learnt at the bootcamp.
Please check the project at https://jpmurara.github.io/bootcampProject-pricingPannel

The Pricing Panel was my very first project using purely CSS without frameworks and HTML. The key feature of this project is the use of flex box. In this project I present a panel comparing three different plans to the user chose one and sign up.
Hours spent in this project: 12h
